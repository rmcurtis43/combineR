      "bio": "Hansford, a four-star recruit and first-team USA Today District of Columbia selection from St. John's College High School, considered committing to UCLA because of offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone. When Mazzone moved on to A&M to work with head coach Kevin Sumlin, Hansford took his game to College Station. He redshirted in 2016 after playing two games as a reserve tight end; he then played in seven games on offense the following season (3-39-13.0 receiving). An injury sidelined him in 2018 and Jimbo Fisher's coaches decided to move Hansford to linebacker. He started one of 13 appearances in 2019 (15 tackles, three for loss with two sacks, two pass breakups) and showed enough promise that he moved into a larger role when Anthony Hines opted out of the 2020 season due to COVID-19. Hansford posted 49 stops, seven for loss with three sacks in nine starts. He initially accepted an invite to the 2021 Senior Bowl but decided to return to school in the fall. He started all 12 games in 2021, leading the Aggies with 89 tackles, 8.5 for loss with two sacks while breaking up four passes. The team could not play in the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl due to COVID-19 issues on the squad. -- by Chad Reuter",

Hansford failed to use his 2020 season as a springboard into bigger and better things in 2021. He has speed to range from sideline to sideline and is a fundamentally sound tackler who won't let many slip from his grasp. His blitz potential should not be discounted and he clearly has the traits to become a more robust playmaker. However, the difference between starter and backup will be rooted in whether or not he can do a better job of diagnosing blocking schemes and play with better trigger quickness.",

The two-time Wolverines captain was also the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy, a rare feat for a defender (former Michigan cornerback Charles Woodson is the only defensive player to win the award), and a finalist for the William V.

He can be too mechanical, engaging in cursory contact rather than using his hands to whip the man in front of him quickly. Hutchinson is an instinctive rusher, assailing the pocket with a non-stop barrage of activity. His hands are skilled and efficient to grease the edge while fluid counter steps open inside paths to the pocket. He needs to add a few more items to his rush menu in order to maintain his rush production against NFL tackles. Hutchinson is scheme versatile and should be a very good starter with a very high floor, but his ceiling might not be as elevated as some of the talent he's been compared to.",

Melton was the team's leading receiver in 2019 (30-427-14.2, two TDs; 4-22-5.5 rushing in 12 starts) and 2020 (47-638-13.6, six TDs; 6-69-11.5, two TDs rushing; 6-177-29.5 kick returns in nine starts). Melton also recovered a teammates' fumbled punt return 58 yards for a touchdown in 2020, eventually receiving honorable mention All-Big Ten Conference accolades for his efforts. He didn't make the all-conference list in 2021 but was again Rutgers' top pass-catcher (55-618-11.2, three TDs) and contributed as a rusher (9-51-5.7) and returner (5-116-23.2 kicks; 5-38-7.6 punts).

He can be used as an add-on run defender, match up on \"F\" tight ends or play on the back-end. Cook needs to answer questions about his speed and play with focus and leverage as an open-field tackler, but he's reliable and talented. He could become a good starter early in his career.",

He joined the football team as a preferred walk-on (just like NFL wideout Anthony Miller) and the track squad as a sprinter. He earned 2019 second-team All-American track honors in the 4x100-meter relay and several All-American Athletic Conference honors in various events. As a redshirt freshman with the football team in 2018, Austin played in 11 games as a reserve (2-24-12.0 receiving; 83-yard TD in his only carry). He played in 13 games off the bench in 2019 (17-315-18.5, three TDs receiving; 4-3-0.8, one TD rushing), finally getting his scholarship after a team win against Houston in November. Austin was a first-team All-AAC selection in 2020 after ranking sixth in the FBS with 11 receiving touchdowns and eighth with 1,053 receiving yards on 63 receptions for 16.7 yards per catch. He also scored on one punt return that season (20-188-9.4). He led the Tigers in receiving again in 2021 (74-1,149-15.5, eight TDs in 12 games, including 11 starts) to receive first-team all-conference notice while also scoring on his only rushing attempt (69 yards) and on a controversial 94-yard punt return (5-135-27.0 on punt returns for the year). Austin opted out of the Hawaii Bowl but the game was eventually cancelled as the Hawaii football program had COVID-19 issues. -- by Chad Reuter",

His surgically repaired right knee might hinder the sturdiness of his throwing base, but Strong still throws with velocity, accuracy and touch either on or off-platform. He has the talent to attack any coverage and all areas of the field. Nonchalant eye discipline and a gunslinger mentality means he's likely to see additional air traffic and turnovers as he transitions from Nevada's Air Raid offense. Scouts rave about his leadership and \"killer instinct.\" He clearly has first-round talent, but long-term durability concerns surrounding his knee could force teams to take a more cautious approach with his projection and draft slotting.",

With 2020 third-round pick Logan Wilson off to the NFL, Muma became the defense's bellcow, garnering first-team All-Mountain West Conference accolades by ranking third in the FBS with 11.8 tackles per game (72 in six starts) and topping his squad with eight for loss and three sacks. He exploded onto the national scene as a senior, earning third-team Associated Press All-American and first-team all-conference honors, as well as being named a finalist for the Butkus Award, which honors the country's top linebacker. Muma ranked second in the FBS with 142 tackles (eight for loss) and returned two of his three INTs for scores in 13 starts. -- by Chad Reuter",

Hinton and his father are not the only athletes in the family. His mother, Mya, played basketball at Northwestern and brother, Myles, is an offensive lineman at Stanford. -- by Chad Reuter",

He gained 15 pounds of solid muscle between his freshman and sophomore seasons at Ohio State, and there was an immediate benefit. Olave garnered third-team All-Big Ten accolades, becoming an essential target for Heisman Trophy finalist quarterback Justin Fields as the team leader in receiving yards and touchdowns (48-840-17.5, 12 TDs in 14 games, six starts). Olave showed maturity at the end of the season, taking the blame for slipping on a route where Fields threw an interception at the end of the national semifinal game against Clemson. He was the Buckeyes' top receiving option in 2020, finishing the season among the national leaders in receptions and receiving yards (50-729-14.6) while starting all seven games to earn first-team all-conference honors for the FBS runner-up. He received second-team Associated Press All-American and first-team all-conference notice in his final year, tying for sixth in the FBS with 13 receiving TDs to become the school's all-time leader in the category. His 35 beat out NFL stars David Boston, Cris Carter and Santonio Holmes. Olave caught 65 passes for 936 yards (14.4 per rec.) in 12 starts for the Buckeyes, opting out of the team's bowl game to prepare for the NFL draft.

      "bio": "Turner switched from receiver to tight end for the 2020 season, resulting in a first-team All-Mountain West Conference junior campaign with the Wolf Pack. He tied for the team lead with nine receiving touchdowns in nine starts (49-605-12.3), including two scores in the team's win over Tulane in the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl. His second year at the position was also a success, garnering second-team all-conference honors (62-677-10.9, 10 TDs in 11 starts). The first-team all-state receiver at Clackamas High School in Oregon played in 12 games as a reserve wideout as a true freshman (2-37-18.5, one TD) and in all 13 games of his sophomore campaign (4-51-12.8). Turner opted out of the team's 2021 bowl game to prepare for the NFL draft. His father, Kelly, played football at Purdue. -- by Chad Reuter",

He's a pass-catching tight end who needs to hit the weights and add necessary functional strength to play through contact. He has talent but is inconsistent finishing difficult catches and needs to prove he can become a legitimate every-down catch threat against NFL defenders and not just a height mismatch in the red zone. Turner is a Day 3 prospect with limited blocking and special teams value, so he'll need continued growth as a pass-catching weapon to earn an extended NFL stay.",

Another brother, Craig Jr., played football at Middle Tennessee State and another, Corey, played basketball at Georgia Tech.

Heyward played in 12 games as a reserve his true freshman season (3-10-3.3 rushing; 4-13-3.3, one TD receiving; 20-436-21.8 kick returns), but his game took off in 2019, when he was named a finalist for the Paul Hornung Award as the nation's most versatile player (led team with 118-529-4.5, five TDs rushing; 32-249-7.8 receiving; 13-287-22.1 kick returns in 13 games, eight starts). After playing in four games as a reserve in 2019 (24-79-3.3 rushing; 7-52-7.4, one TD receiving), however, he redshirted and entered the transfer portal. The hiring of new head coach Mel Tucker changed his mind and he started six of seven contests for the Spartans in 2020 (65-200-3.1 rushing; 18-71-3.9, two TDs receiving). Heyward moved to tight end in 2021, garnering honorable mention All-Big Ten Conference honors (35-326-9.3, two TDs receiving; 1-7-7.0 rushing in 13 starts). -- by Chad Reuter",

However, he was prolific as a passer in the Greater Houston area, throwing for over 10,000 yards while rushing for another 3,000. Then-head coach Tom Herman kept King home, along with five-star recruit Ed Oliver, in a recruiting coup despite the school's non-Power Five Conference status. King got on the field as a receiver his freshman year, starting four times in 10 games (29-228-7.9, one TD receiving; 15-56-3.7 rushing). He also returned kicks (10-254-25.4, one TD) and played quarterback at the end of the season (2-of-3, 20 yards, one TD). He split time at the two positions again in 2017 after returning from an injury, starting three games at receiver (29-264-9.1, two TDs) and four times at quarterback as a sophomore (90-of-139, 64.7%, 1,260 yards, seven TDs, two INTs; 72-379-5.3, eight TDs rushing). King was finally installed as the full-time starting quarterback in 2018 and was leading the FBS with 50 total touchdowns (36 passing, 14 rushing) before suffering a torn meniscus. He completed 63.5 percent of his passes (219-of-345) on the year and was a major rushing threat (111-674-6.1) when leading the team to eight wins in his 11 starts. King started the first four games of the 2019 season (58-of-110, 52.7%, 663 yards, six TDs, two INTs; 55-312-5.7, six TDs rushing) before deciding to shut it down on the suggestion of head coach Dana Holgorsen -- redshirting in order to utilize another year of eligibility in 2020. King transferred to Miami for that final collegiate season, starting all 11 games as team captain for the 8-3 Hurricanes and garnering honorable mention All-ACC accolades (211-of-329, 64.1%, 2,686 yards, 23 TDs, five INTs; 130-538-4.1, four TDs rushing). Unfortunately, King tore his ACL in the team's bowl game after he had decided to return to Miami for another season. He was the starter in the team's first three games (81-of-122, 66.4%, 767 yards, three TDs, four INTs; 40-96-2.4 rushing) before suffering a season-ending right (throwing) shoulder injury.

Others who’ve worn No. 18 include quarterback Matt Mauck (who won a national title), tight end Foster Moreau, fullback Jacob Hester and pass rusher K'Lavon Chaisson, among others. Clark had to help make up for the departed Jacob Phillips and Patrick Queen that season, starting five of 10 games played (63 tackles, four for loss with one sack). His 2021 efforts put him squarely in the sights of scouts and gained him first-team All-SEC and Butkus Award finalist accolades. Clark ranked fourth in the FBS with 135 tackles, led the Tigers with 15.5 tackles for loss (with 5.5 sacks), intercepted one pass, broke up three others and forced two fumbles in 12 starts.

His game took a step up in 2020, when he garnered second-team All-American Athletic Conference honors (58 tackles, 7.5 for loss with 2.5 sacks, two interceptions, four pass break-ups).  Beavers not only graduated to first-team all-conference honors in 2021 (102 tackles, 11.5 for loss, with 4.5 sacks, one interception, two pass break-ups, two forced fumbles in 14 starts) but was also named a finalist for the Butkus Award, given to the nation's top linebacker. -- by Chad Reuter",

      "overview": "Inside linebacker with throwback size but also throwback athleticism that fails to fit cleanly into today's brand of football. Beavers is a phone-booth linebacker who is well-schooled in taking on and slipping blocks between the tackles but can be overwhelmed by athletic opponents when forced to move and play in space. He plays too stiff-legged and with a lack of desired agility, which gets him tangled up in traffic more than teams might like. He'll need to lean into a role as a thumper to make a team, which will require improvement in consistently attacking and discarding blockers. Beavers has a challenging road ahead of him but his background as a core special-teamer helps.",

He was a first-team all-conference selection for the second straight year in 2020, leading the Hilltoppers with 11 tackles for loss and six sacks with 71 total tackles in 12 starts, while forcing two fumbles and tying for fifth in the FBS with two blocked kicks. Malone finished his career in style as he again was named the Conference USA Defensive Player of the Year after tying for ninth in the FBS with 17.5 tackles for loss, including a team-high nine sacks among his 94 tackles and four pass breakups, and tying for 10th with four forced fumbles in 14 starts. He also holds the WKU career record for sacks with 34. -- by Chad Reuter",

Malone's wiry build belies his toughness and play strength at the point of attack. He uses quick feet, a flexible frame and unusually successful recovery balance to slink into playmaking positions in the run game. His rush is unorthodox and unpredictable but his burst to close and fluidity inside the pocket are valuable in finishing against mobile quarterbacks. His slender frame will get knocked and he needs to craft a more repeatable rush, but he is competitive and savvy. Malone could challenge for a future starting job as a 3-4 outside linebacker and offers immediate special-teams value.",

He enrolled early but had surgery on a pre-existing injury, so he did not partake in 2019 spring practices. Leal played well enough in the fall, however, to be named the team's Top Defensive Newcomer (38 tackles, 5.5 for loss with two sacks, in 13 games) after taking over as a starter for seven games when Micheal Clemons went down to injury. He started all 10 games for the Aggies in 2020 (37 tackles, seven for loss with 2.5 sacks, one interception, three pass breakups) and was named to the Associated Press All-Bowl Team with his seven tackles, one for loss, in the Orange Bowl win over North Carolina. Leal played defensive end most of that season but shifted inside when Justin Madubuike left the team to prepare for the NFL draft. The Associated Press named Leal a first-team All-American in 2021, SEC coaches voted him a first-team all-conference pick and he was named a finalist for the Ted Hendricks Award as the nation's top defensive end after racking up 58 tackles, 12.5 for loss with 8.5 sacks, and two pass breakups in 12 starts.

He's intelligent and processes quickly, which should help him find where the football needs to go regardless of passing scheme. Getting the ball to NFL targets accurately and safely, however, is not a given. Despite favorable mechanics, his accuracy and ball placement need work and he doesn't have the arm strength or release quickness to consistently survive off-target throws against pro coverage. He can run but is more of a pocket passer who can win with his legs than a true dual-threat quarterback. ",

He enrolled in January 2017 and redshirted the following fall, playing in one game as a reserve (no statistics). Perry played in five games as a back-up in 2018 (27-of-39, 69.2%, 277 yards, two TDs; 20-70-3.5, one TD rushing) before transferring to Brown University. He was not able to beat out BC starter Anthony Brown but transferring also gave him the opportunity to play for his uncle James, the Bears' head coach. Perry garnered 2019 first-team All-Ivy League accolades by setting the conference record and leading the FCS with 3,678 yards of total offense in 10 starts (251-of-418, 60.0%, 2,948 yards, 22 TDs, 13 INTs; 142-730-5.1, eight TDs rushing). The school did not play in the fall of 2020 or spring of 2021 due to COVID-19 concerns. Perry returned with another first-team All-Ivy performance in the fall, bringing in Offensive Player of the Year honors by ranking eighth in the FCS with 303.3 passing yards per game (295-of-444, 66.4%, 23 TDs, 14 INTs; 111-402-3.6, seven TDs rushing) in 10 starts. -- by Chad Reuter",

His long speed is good, but the acceleration burst is what makes him such an effective separator in space. He might not be smooth getting there, but he has eye-popping ball skills when it's time to go make a play. Wilson needs to work on his ability to consistently uncover on all three levels, but he has the traits to become a very good WR2 if he tightens up areas of concern.",

      "bio": "Bell began his collegiate career at Arizona Western Community College, where he was a two-time first-team junior college All-American and was ranked among the top 20 JUCO recruits in the country. The California native signed with Nebraska, but after just four games (three starts, 35-173-4.9 rushing; 4-14-3.5 receiving), decided to transfer. Head coach Scott Frost blocked him from going to Big Ten schools, non-conference opponents and Oregon State (with multiple Huskers transferring there due to their quarterly calendar). Bell returned home to San Diego for the 2019 season but was forced to redshirt after a freak training accident nearly cost him the sight in his right eye. His 2020 vision appeared just fine, as he attained second-team All-Mountain West status after leading the Aztecs with 637 rushing yards and six scores on 113 carries (5.6 per). He also caught 11 passes for 114 yards (10.4 per) and a touchdown. Bell was again a second-team selection in 2021 with team highs in rushing yards and touchdowns (245-1,091-4.5, nine TDs; 4-5-1.3 receiving in 14 games, 13 starts). -- by Chad Reuter",

He's resilient and a dedicated worker and carries that mentality with him in San Diego State's outside zone attack. Bell runs with good vision and plenty of courage but may not get much more than is blocked for him as a pro. His comeback story is a great one, but without special teams or third-down value, the deck could be stacked against him.",

He processes the front fairly quickly and has the agility to re-adjust his running lanes to create something out of nothing, but he also has a tendency to bounce runs wide too frequently. Pacheco plays the game with an NFL demeanor and could give himself an even better chance of becoming an RB2/3 if he can step up his pass protection and third down value.",

It's a million dollars in the air. If you want it, you go get it.\" Big Ten coaches appreciated his financial acumen, voting him third-team all-conference at receiver (PSU leader with 52 receptions, 884 yards, eight scores with 17.0 yards per catch in nine starts) and honorable mention as a punt returner (8-197-24.6, one TD). Dotson capped off his career with 2021 third-team Associated Press All-American and second-team All-Big Ten accolades at receiver, leading Penn State with 91 receptions and 1,182 receiving yards and tying for eighth in the country with 12 receiving scores in 12 starts (opted out of the team's bowl game to prepare for the NFL draft). He also received third-team all-league notice for his return abilities (14-104-7.4 punt returns). Dotson initially committed to UCLA as a top 150 overall recruit nationally but eventually decided to stay close to Nazareth, where he grew up. He played in eight games (12-203-15.6) with starts in the final four contests as a true freshman before starting all 13 appearances in 2019 (27-488-18.1, five TDs; 2-39-19.5 punt returns). Gloria Bigelow, Dotson's grandmother, with whom he was very close, passed away in April 2020. He wears a T-shirt with her image on the front for each game. -- by Chad Reuter",

Barnes ran with Baylor in the 2019 outdoor season, winning the USC Trojan Invitational 100 meters at 10.43. On the football field, he was an all-district player at Silsbee High School in Texas before joining the Bears. He shifted from receiver to cornerback during preseason camp as a true freshman, playing in 11 games as a reserve that season (10 tackles, one pass breakup). Barnes contributed in all 14 games in 2019 (22 tackles, one interception, five pass breakups) before earning a starting job in five of six games played in 2020 (13 tackles, two for loss, one interception, three pass breakups) -- though he missed time at the end of the year (and played with a heavy wrap) due to a thumb injury. Barnes started 10 games in 2021, again missing time due to injury but collecting 24 tackles, an interception and five pass breakups during the year. -- by Chad Reuter",

When asked about why he picked Oregon, Thibodeaux said, \"It was journalism. It was Nike. It was Cristobal. It was the whole program.\" He was an honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick and the conference Defensive Freshman of the Year in 2019 with 35 tackles, including a team-high 14 tackles for loss with nine sacks, three pass breakups and one blocked kick in 14 games with five starts. He led Oregon with 9.5 tackles for loss and three sacks (38 total tackles, three pass breakups) in seven starts as a sophomore, collecting third-team Associated Press All-American honors, winning the Pac-12 Morris Trophy as its top lineman and earning the Pac-12 Championship Game MVP award. He had 12 quarterback hurries, two tackles for loss with one sack vs. USC in the conference title game. Though Thibodeaux missed time with an ankle injury in 2021, he was still named a first-team Associated Press All-American and finalist for the Chuck Bednarik, Ted Hendricks and Bronko Nagurski Awards.

He won the Walter Camp Player of the Year and Doak Walker (nation's top running back) awards in addition to receiving first-team Associated Press All-American and Big Ten Running Back of the Year honors by ranking second in the FBS with 1,636 rushing yards (263 carries, 6.2 per) and tying for eighth with 18 rushing scores in 12 starts (also 13-89-6.8, one TD receiving). Walker, who finished sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting, opted out of the team's bowl game to prepare for the NFL draft. -- by Chad Reuter",

He can find his own yards with twitchy directional change when run-blocking breaks down and possesses plus-rated contact balance to add on to his yardage throughout the game. Walker is a very determined runner who is more reactive than instinctive, which leads to wild shifts in his rush track. He can handle RB1 workload in terms of carries but needs work as a third-down option. Walker would benefit from better rush-track discipline, but his explosiveness and unpredictable style should still lead to success as a future starter.",

He started all 14 games the next season, throwing for 1,969 yards (180-310-58.1) and 12 touchdowns (six INTs) while scoring three times on the ground (117-220-1.9). The former top-10, pro-style quarterback recruit from Ocean Township High School in New Jersey was the full-time starter as a junior, as well, completing 61.6 percent of his passes (289-of-469) for 3,098 yards and 13 touchdowns against nine interceptions (also 95-110-1.2, two TDs rushing). Pickett was the Quick Lane Bowl MVP (27-of-39, 361 yards, three TDs) in the team's win over Eastern Michigan, setting a school record with a 96-yard TD pass. The 2020 team captain started nine games that season (203-of-332, 61.1%, 2,408 yards, 13 TDs, nine INTs; 81-145-1.8, eight TDs rushing), missing two contests with an ankle injury. Pickett decided to return to school instead of going to the NFL for one final season in 2021, which paid off handsomely with many awards (Johnny Unitas Golden Arm, Senior CLASS Award, second-team Associated Press All-American, ACC Player of the Year and Offensive Player of the Year) in addition to landing finalist spots for the Heisman Trophy (finished third in the voting), Maxwell Award, Walter Camp Player of the Year and Davey O'Brien Award. He led the Panthers to the ACC Championship, ranked sixth in the FBS with a school-record 4,319 passing yards and fourth with 334 completions (497 attempts, 67.2 percent) and an ACC-record 42 passing touchdowns (just seven INT). Pickett also broke Pitt career records with 12,303 passing yards and broke Dan Marino's record with 81 passing touchdowns. He also used his feet to run for 241 yards and five scores in 2021. Pickett started 13 games in his final year, opting out of the team's bowl game to prepare for the 2022 NFL Draft.

He operated in a passing scheme featuring vertical concepts that created big-play opportunities but left food on the plate when he failed to play chess against the back-end of the coverage. Pickett works with average anticipation but drives the ball with good velocity, which should help him shine in pre-draft passing drills. Pickett's touch and placement need work, but his accuracy stats were damaged by an inordinate amount of drops throughout his career. The top indicator for future success or failure will likely rest in a team's ability to build Pickett's trust, poise and discipline from the pocket. He can make all the throws, but he'll only be able to execute against disguised fronts and NFL pressure if he's willing to hang in and win with his eyes first. He carries a boom/bust label, but the 2021 tape and productivity showed off his potential to become a good starter in time.",

He's a chain mover with excellent ball security as a battering ram inside. He will be limited as an outside runner and needs to come off the field on passing downs. Harris has talent and his impressive 2020 was no mirage. He's a good Day 3 option for teams looking to upgrade their power.",

      "bio": "Chenal (pronounced sha-NELL) was a small-school All-American, Wisconsin Gatorade Player of the Year and named the state's Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year as a senior at Grantsburg High School. He played in 11 games as a reserve as a true freshman (20 tackles, two for loss, with one sack) before starting all seven games in 2020 to garner honorable mention All-Big Ten Conference honors (46 tackles, six for loss, with three sacks, one interception). Chenal became known nationally in 2021 while leading the country's top-rated defense. He finished among the national leaders with 18.5 tackles for loss (with eight sacks), led his squad with 115 tackles and forced two fumbles in 11 starts to earn second-team Associated Press All-American and Big Ten Conference Linebacker of the Year honors. Chenal accomplished these feats despite missing the year's first two games after testing positive for COVID-19. He switched from the 45 jersey to No. 5 for 2021 -- but not as a nod the famous perfume. Rather, Chenal carried that digit in high school to emulate his older brother, who also wore it. -- by Chad Reuter",

His limbs absorb contact without losing balance or positioning. The power and toughness are outstanding but his technique, play recognition and discipline need more work. He's tightly bound, lacking the fluidity and lateral agility for consistent success as an open-field tackler. He won't offer much in coverage but has success as a power blitzer. Chenal has rare point-of-attack power and will be a handful inside the box, but will be limited by athletic deficiencies. He might never be more than a good backup or low-end starter but he should be able to make a living in the league.",

      "bio": "Willis transferred from Auburn to Liberty after the 2018 season when Auburn coaches decided he would not be the starter. The NCAA denied his waiver request to play immediately, so he redshirted with the Flames in 2019. He took his team to new heights in 2020, leading Liberty to a 9-1 record in his 10 starts with his arm (170-of-265, 64.2%, 2,250, 20 TDs, six INTs) and his legs, as he led all FBS quarterbacks with 944 rushing yards (141 carries, 6.7 yards per carry) and tied for seventh among all FBS players with 14 rushing touchdowns. He tested positive for COVID-19 in December but did not miss any games as the Flames' regular-season game against Coastal Carolina was canceled (they beat Coastal in the Mortgage Cure Bowl). They took a step back in 2021 (going 8-5) though Willis made plays through the air (207-of-339, 61.1%, 2,857 yards, 27 TDs, 12 INTs) and led the squad in rushing (197-878-4.5, 13 TDs). He was named the LendingTree Bowl MVP after leading Liberty to a win over Eastern Michigan (13-of-24, 231 yards, 3 TDs; 8-58, 2 TDs rushing). Willis played two seasons for the Tigers, playing in seven games in 2017 (6-of-7, 45 yards, one TD; 16-221-13.8, one TD rushing) and nine contests the following year (5-of-7, 24 yards passing; 12-88-7.3, one TD rushing). Willis was the Georgia Class 7A Offensive Player of the Year at Roswell High School, leading his team to the state title game his senior year. His uncle, James Anderson, played LB at Virginia Tech and for 10 seasons in the NFL. -- by Chad Reuter",

      "overview": "Upside quarterback with special parts of his game, but with no guarantee they will be assembled properly into a finished product. Willis uses his rare combination of elite rushing talent and a rocket-launching right arm to unlock explosive plays in two different ways. He has the arm to beat safeties to the deepest parts of the field and makes impressive throws from inside and outside the pocket. On the flip side, Willis' mechanical and operational inconsistencies lead to erratic timing and accuracy, and he doesn't throw with enough touch. Protection and receiver separation were both issues, but Willis also pressed over the second half of the season and never looked comfortable in the Liberty offense. On the pro level, additional film work and a layered, pro-style passing attack could allow for more focused reads and help him see the field faster and more clearly from the pocket. Play-callers must lean into his special talent as a runner and include called runs into the game plan. Even if Willis fails to reach his passing potential, running ability doesn't slump and he has the talent to produce on the ground at a level between Jalen Hurts and Lamar Jackson.",

The next year, Borghi led the Cougars with 817 rushing yards, 11 rushing scores (127 carries, 6.4 per) and 86 receptions (597 yards, 6.9 per, five TDs) in 13 starts, receiving honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors. When Leach left for Mississippi State, Borghi jokingly tweeted that he expected to get more carries in the new offense. Unfortunately, he was forced to miss three of the team's four games in 2020 (10-95-9.5, one TD rushing; 1-7-7.0 receiving) with a back injury suffered in preseason camp. He returned in 2021 to earn honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice as WSU's top rusher (160-880-5.5, 12 TDs) while catching 16 passes for 156 yards (9.8 per) in 12 games with 11 starts.

To his credit, Borghi's stat line has been solid in all three seasons he was healthy and he offers rushing and receiving versatility out of the backfield. However, he's a linear runner lacking short-area wiggle and he is much more brake-oriented than gas-oriented when it comes time to hit it between the tackles. Borghi's acceleration turns into quality top speed to the perimeter or in the open field, but it is hard to project a successful NFL career given his issues creating for himself and an unwillingness to hammer it inside.",

That injury did not cause him any issues in the fall, as he became the third player to win the Butkus Award in college and high school, joining former Notre Dame stars Manti Te'o and Jaylon Smith.

Dean's play recognition is a work in progress, which limits reaction time and forces him to deal with more blockers than he'll see as he gains more experience. Quick feet and plus agility will bring him to ball-carriers at a high rate but a lack of size and length means he'll need to fine-tune his approach as a tackler to make sure he finishes what he starts. He might lack measurables, but he has the toughness and technique to see a boost in his performance once his play becomes more proactive.",

He eventually wound up in California, where he earned Northern California and East Bay Defensive Player of the Year as a senior (32 TFL and 38-577, seven TDs receiving). Landman played in 11 games as a reserve during his first season with Colorado in 2017 (14 tackles, four for loss) before becoming a playmaker for the Buffaloes. He garnered honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors and was named UC's Co-Defensive Player of the Year in 2018 with a team-high 103 tackles, 15 for loss with four sacks, two interceptions, three pass breaksup and two forced fumbles in 12 starts. Landman made first-team all-conference as a junior, again leading the Buffs with 114 tackles (83 solo, eight for loss, two sacks) in 12 starts, and as a senior in 2020 (53 tackles, nine for loss with four sacks) in five starts. He tied for second in the FBS with 7.8 solo tackles per game and tied for eighth with 1.8 tackles for loss per game, though he ruptured an Achilles tendon in the regular-season finale. A shoulder injury limited Landman in 2021 but Pac-12 coaches still voted him second-team all-conference (63 tackles, six for loss, four pass breakups in seven starts). His brother, Brendan, played TE at Arizona State while his sister, Ocean Trail, swam at Oregon State. -- by Chad Reuter",

However, his block sustain and finish are occasionally derailed by modest knee bend and core strength at the point of attack. Athletic feet and reactive athleticism allow him to stay connected to outside edge speed or inside counters in his pass sets. Despite his foot agility, he is just average in getting three-techniques reached on backside zone blocks, but there is a noticeable pop into initial contact when coming off the ball and getting downhill. Field toughness, an NFL frame and pass protection ability give Zakelj a shot as a swing tackle with the potential to develop into a bigger contributor.",

The three-star recruit from Lake Park High School in Illinois garnered second-team All-Big 12 Conference accolades in his first year in Norman. He started eight of 11 games played (19 tackles, six for loss, three pass breakups) and made a huge play when blocking a field goal against rival Texas in the third overtime to help the Sooners get the victory. Winfrey stated after the game that he noticed a Texas lineman was breathing hard and asked a teammate to switch spots so he could take advantage of the weakness. He was named a second-team All-Big 12 Conference selection in 2021, posting 23 tackles, 11 for loss with 5.5 sacks in 12 starts.

He's a high-cut receiver with tight hips who is more speedy than athletic. When healthy, he takes the top off of defenses with high-power acceleration that can lead to long touchdowns. However, he lacks the short-area agility to beat tight man coverage with route success. Medicals will play a big role in determining his draft day value, but when healthy Roberson, will still need a more limited route tree for optimal results.",

He muscles throws, hindering his accuracy on drive throws but has adequate arm strength and can expedite off-platform throws. Howell doesn't throw with nearly enough timing or ball placement, which forces wideouts into the boundaries or to break stride, limiting their YAC potential. He flashed impressive dual-threat talent in 2021, which should work in his favor. The 2021 tape was bumpy but his makeup is really good and improvement is likely with better pieces around him. Howell isn't wired for or suited to a ball-control passing attack and might need a vertical passing scheme capable of creating explosive plays in order to succeed.",

Gardner collected 28 tackles, three interceptions and six pass breakups as a sophomore in nine games (missed the bowl game vs. Georgia due to a back injury) in 2020 to earn second-team Associated Press All-American and American Athletic Conference accolades. He switched from the No. 12 jersey to No. 1 for 2021 and played like the nation's top corner while garnering first-team Associated Press All-American and American Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year accolades (40 tackles, 4.5 for loss with three sacks, three interceptions, four pass breakups in 14 starts).

He's highly competitive with a confidence level that will be labeled as cocky by some evaluators. \"Sauce\" uses length and hand activity to impose his will on the release and stall the route on the tarmac. Staying connected to the route is a priority, which leads to grabbing when he feels it slipping away but that can be corrected by improving his footwork and trusting his technique. His movements lack fluidity, but he's urgent and aggravating in man-to-man, which could become a deterrent for NFL quarterbacks scanning to his side of the field if he can avoid a big spike in penalties as he adjusts to NFL officiating. Gardner has the traits and demeanor to become a highly effective CB1 within his first couple of seasons.",

He enrolled a semester early at Alabama, practicing at safety because of a lack of numbers at the position. After redshirting the 2018 campaign (playing in one game), Bolden began contributing as a receiver the following year (2-34-17.0 receiving; 4-10-2.5 rushing). He became a threat from the slot (24-270-11.2, one TD) and on special teams (7-49-7.0 punt returns) during the team's successful run through the 2020 College Football Playoff. In 2021, Bolden started 11 of 15 games and set career highs with 42 receptions, 408 yards (9.7 per catch) and three scores while returning kickoffs (5-67-13.4) and punts (15-99-6.6). -- by Chad Reuter",

Bernard contributed heavily on defense in 2018 (47 tackles, three for loss, one interception) while starting two of 11 games played. He became a team leader on the field the following season, garnering second-team All-Big 12 accolades after leading the Bears with 112 tackles, 9.5 for loss, with 4.5 sacks, one interception, two pass break-ups and three fumble recoveries. Bernard was a second-team All-Big 12 selection again in 2020 (55 tackles, 6.5 for loss, with 3.5 sacks, one interception, two pass break-ups) despite playing only five games because of a season-ending shoulder injury (torn labrum, fracture). He started 13 games in 2021 and ascended to first-team all-league status by leading BU with 106 tackles and 7.5 sacks (among 12.5 tackles for loss) and breaking up four passes.

His heavy feet prevent fluid change of direction or sustained mirroring so matchup-based struggles are likely.

He plays with violent hands, sluggish feet and all-day aggressiveness. He has quick-shed ability to make plays near his gaps but lacks lateral quickness to play with desired range. He won't be considered a skilled or threatening rusher from any alignment but can plow his way forward to find occasional success. He's effective against the run but is likely to be a one-way player who comes off the field on passing downs.",

His decision to stay near home for college paid off his true freshman year, as he started five of 12 games played (7-89-12.7, one TD). McBride was a first-team All-Mountain West Conference pick as a sophomore (45-560-12.4, four TDs in 12 games, 11 starts) and a second-team selection the following season (team-high 22-330-14.0, four TDs in four starts). He considered transferring before the Mountain West decided to play a shortened fall season due to COVID-19 concerns. Rams fans were happy McBride stayed for 2020 and 2021, when he won the John Mackey Award as the nation's best tight end. The first-team Associated Press All-American and all-league selection ranked ninth in the country with 90 receptions and led the team with 1,121 receiving yards (setting school career records in both categories) despite scoring only once through the air. On the final play of his collegiate career, he ran a fake punt 69 yards for a score against Nevada. -- by Chad Reuter",

McBride lacks top-end speed and quickness into the route, but he can snap off route breaks and has the body control and sticky hands to win contested catch battles. Long athletes could suffocate his catch space if he doesn't play with more physicality and aggression during the route.

He showed skills on offense and defense during his career at Beaverhead County High School in Montana, starring at safety and quarterback as well as twice winning state titles in the 100- and 200-meter dashes. Bobcats coaches played Andersen in 11 games his true freshman season, starting him at running back in the opener (90-515-5.7, five TDs rushing on the season; 7-45-6.5, one TD receiving) and also once at linebacker (nine tackles, one sack) later in the season. Andersen was the Big Sky Conference Freshman of the Year and a Freshman All-American that season. He moved to quarterback for the 2018 season, earning first-team All-Big Sky Conference honors (115-of-208, 55.3 percent completion rate, 1,195 yards, three TDs, seven INTs passing; 206-1,412-6.9, 21 TDs rushing in 13 games, 11 starts). He was a first-team all-conference pick in 2019, as well, but for his work as a linebacker (54 tackles, 11.5 for loss, with 6.5 sacks, one interception, five pass break-ups) as well as at running back (49-336-6.9, seven TDs). In three of his 11 starts, Andersen was on the field with the No. 1 offense, as well as on defense. He suffered a lower-body injury in November, missing the final four games of the year. Doctors thought his injury would heal without surgery, but it did not, so he underwent surgery in early 2020 and would have missed the fall season, had the school played. Andersen was good to go for 2021, grabbing first-team Associated Press FCS All-American and Big Sky Conference Defensive Player of the Year honors by ranking second in the FCS with 147 tackles (14 for loss, with two sacks), intercepting two passes (one returned for a score) and breaking up seven in 15 starts for the national runners-up.

Chandler tied for the team lead with four rushing touchdowns in 2020 (100-456-4.6) and caught 16 passes for 111 yards (6.9 per). He had an impact on offense and special teams as a true freshman, as well, even starting once in 12 appearances (71-305-4.3, two TDs rushing; 10-108-10.8 receiving; 17-416-24.5, one TD on kick returns). Chandler moved on to North Carolina for the 2021 season, helping make up for the loss of Michael Carter and Javonte Williams. He garnered second-team All-ACC accolades by leading the Tar Heels with 1,092 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns (182 carries, 6.0 per) and catching 15 passes for 216 yards (14.4) and a score in 13 starts. -- by Chad Reuter",

After sharing carries at Tennessee, Chandler took a bigger bite out of the pie at North Carolina, seeing spikes in yardage, yards per carry and touchdown production. He's a smooth strider who can become a little disjointed when processing and attacking the blocking scheme. Chandler needs to turn up the play speed in the early stages to attack the fleeting run lanes he will see in the pros. In a deep running back draft, Chandler's ability to catch passes and return kicks should help improve his chance of being selected on Day 3.",

      "bio": "Smith joined the Cleveland Heights High School football team in his junior season and went on to be named Co-Division I Defensive Player of the Year as a senior. He was also the leading scorer and rebounder for the school’s basketball team that year -- no surprise since his mother and father played hoops at Park Point University and his brother played at UNC-Asheville and Bryant University. Back on the gridiron, Smith flashed his talent in 13 games as a reserve in his first year in Columbus (nine tackles). Playing across from top NFL prospect Chase Young in 2019, Smith showed real potential while starting four of 11 contests played (12 tackles, five for loss with three sacks, two pass breakups). He was an honorable mention All-Big Ten pick in 2020, coming on late in the year to start four of seven games played (eight tackles, one sack) before missing the national title game due to COVID-19 protocols. Big Ten coaches voted him second-team all-conference in 2021, when he posted 26 tackles, five for loss with three sacks and two pass breakups in 10 games (nine starts). -- by Chad Reuter",

He excelled at a second-team All-SEC level by ranking third in the country with a school-record 104 receptions that covered 1,334 yards, also a Kentucky record. He scored seven times through the air while rushing for 111 yards (seven carries, 15.9 per att.) and returning punts (6-20-3.3) in 13 games with 12 starts. Robinson was named the 2022 Citrus Bowl MVP (10-170-17.0 receiving), which the Wildcats won over Iowa. He was a four-star recruit and Mr. Football in the state of Kentucky as a senior at Western Hills High School (6,795 career rushing yards, averaged 11 yards per carry). Robinson was an honorable mention All-Big Ten Conference pick and Freshman All-American for the Huskers in 2019, starting four of 10 games played (40-453-11.3, two TDs receiving; 88-340-3.9, three TDs rushing; 11-236-21.5 kick returns; three starts at receiver, one at running back). He had won the Paul Hornung Award as Kentucky's top high school football player in 2018 and was a finalist for the Paul Hornung Award as college football's most versatile player the following fall. Robinson was an honorable mention all-conference pick in 2020, as well, leading Nebraska with 51 receptions for 461 receiving yards (9.0 per, one TD) while starting six games outside and two at running back (46-240-5.2, one TD rushing).

      "overview": "Undersized linebacker but you wouldn't know it by the way McClain plays the game. His block take-ons are explosive and worthy of highlight reels by themselves. His lack of size doesn't factor as much as expected, but his lack of length catches up with him as both a short-area and pursuit tackler. McClain is more than capable of handling his business near the line of scrimmage but he's an average athlete with unremarkable range who might not offer enough third-down value for some teams. He has good backup talent with a chance to become an eventual starter as an outside 'backer in a 4-3 or inside 'backer in a 3-4.",

      "bio": "\"Zeus\" was a top-10 national recruit, USA Today Offensive Player of the Year finalist and Touchdown Club of Columbus (Ohio) National Player of the Year after rushing for 2,086 yards and 34 touchdowns as a senior at Scotland High School in North Carolina. He also finished sixth in the 100 meters at the 2016 state track meet. Smith had torn an ACL late in his senior season, however, and then tore his other ACL in August 2018, which caused him to redshirt the fall. Former Georgia RB Robert Edwards reached out to White after the 2017 injury, as Edwards' own career was derailed by a knee injury suffered during a Pro Bowl week beach football game. Smith returned for the 2019 season, though, winning the school's David Jacobs Award for overcoming injury by playing in 13 games (78-408-5.2, three TDs rushing; 2-20-10.0 receiving) with one start behind D'Andre Swift and Brian Herrien. That start came in the Sugar Bowl against Baylor, as he gained 92 yards. White started all 10 games in 2020, leading the Bulldogs with 779 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns on 144 carries (5.4 per). He also caught six passes for 37 yards (6.2 per) and even blocked a punt. In 2021, White led the national champions with 856 rushing yards and 11 scores on 160 carries (5.4 per) while catching nine passes for 75 yards (8.3 per) in 15 games (12 starts). He made plays on special teams throughout his career, returning six kickoffs (137 yards, 22.8 per), blocking an Arkansas punt in 2020 and recovering a blocked punt in the end zone against the Razorbacks for a touchdown the following year. -- by Chad Reuter",

He's a wide-base runner who should excel in gap and inside zone schemes but his running style might not lend itself to a long career. He has two ACL tears in his background and is unlikely to play on passing downs, but he's a formidable \"thunder\" back waiting to be paired with a \"lightning\" cohort and will give running games a chance to test the resolve of defenses for four full quarters.",

Looking to take his game to the next level, Johnson transferred to Boston College for his junior year. ACC coaches were impressed enough with his first season with the Eagles that they named him second-team all-conference despite making just seven starts (13 games played) at left guard. He was an All-ACC third-team selection in 2020, as well as a team captain, playing left tackle in all 11 games.

Johnson has experience at tackle, but he's clearly an interior blocker on the next level. He has knock-back pop at the point of attack with the ability to win the block in a test of strength. In space, his limitations become obvious. He'll need to fit into the right scheme that takes advantage of what he does well and diminishes the athletic limitations. He has a ceiling of starting guard in the NFL, but his ability to deal with the athleticism of NFL defensive linemen on all three downs is a concern both as a run blocker and in pass protection.",
